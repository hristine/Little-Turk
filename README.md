Little-Turk
===========

Little Turk is your janky-video-meat-android for accessing APIs.

Little Turk was written for Hack Waterloo,  held in Waterloo in April 2011.  Joyously,  I won first prize!

It's an API query interface that does some hand-wavy natural language parsing of queries;  and while API queries run, Little Turk (a video avatar) simulates the action of performing that query, such as looking for a location on a map, or typing into a laptop.

Setting up a local copy of Little Turk is not for the faint hearted.  Not least of all, several of the APIs will be unavailable.  The html/javascript/css/php expects to live on a webserver in the /turk/ directory, and the contents of the magic folder belong in your home directory.  This will almost certainly only work on OSX, because of the Quartz Composer/QuickTime dark magic involved in showing the video.  You have been warned.

I cannot tell a lie,  I am secretly Little Turk, and Little Turk is me.
